# ar-translate
A browser-based speech-to-text bot that listens to spoken input, transcribes it, and, if necessary, translates it to English. This bot is built using JavaScript, with real-time speech recognition through the Web Speech API and translation capabilities through external APIs. This project is ideal for building accessible web applications and enhancing language-based user interfaces.

## 📋 **Features**

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Converts speech to text in real time using the Web Speech API.
- **Automatic Language Detection**: Identifies the language of the spoken input.
- **Automatic Translation**: Translates non-English input into English, displayed in real time.
- **Simple User Interface**: Offers a start/stop button for easy interaction and displays the results on screen.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

- **JavaScript**: Primary language for front-end functionality.
- **Web Speech API**: Converts speech to text for real-time transcription.
- **Translation API**: Detects language and translates text to English (e.g., Google Translate API).
- **Scribble Pad**: Used for developing and testing JavaScript code quickly.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- **Modern Web Browser**: Chrome is recommended for the best compatibility with the Web Speech API.
- **API Access**: API key for a translation service (like Google Translate) is necessary for language detection and translation.
- **Scribble Pad Tool**: Useful for testing and running JavaScript snippets in the browser.
